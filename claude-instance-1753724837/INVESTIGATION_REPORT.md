## Key Components Analysis

### 1. MCP Server Configuration (.mcp.json)

The project integrates 10+ MCP servers providing diverse capabilities:

- **context7**: Enhanced context management with 6000 minimum tokens
- **linear**: Project management integration
- **memory**: Persistent memory storage
- **puppeteer**: Web automation and browser control
- **sequential-thinking**: Advanced reasoning capabilities
- **mcp-deepwiki**: Repository documentation fetching
- **Figma**: Design tool integration
- **postgres**: Database connectivity
- **playwright**: Browser automation
- **stripe**: Payment processing integration

### 2. Custom Commands System

Located in `.claude/commands/`, providing workflows for:

#### Task Management
- `/analyze`: Multi-agent investigation workflow
- `/task`: Intelligent task routing with complexity analysis
- `/fix`: Direct implementation for simple fixes
- `/hotfix`: Emergency fix workflow

#### Development Workflows
- `/commit`: Intelligent commit with conventional standards
- `/code-review`: Automated code review for uncommitted changes
- `/refactor`: Structured refactoring assistance
- `/debug`: Debugging support workflow

#### Specialized Tasks
- `/security-audit`: Security vulnerability analysis
- `/performance-check`: Performance optimization
- `/doc-gen`: Documentation generation
- `/test`: Testing workflow automation

### 3. Specialized AI Agents

Located in `.claude/agents/`, each agent has specific expertise:

#### Core Investigation Agents
- **investigator**: Uses sequential thinking to find related code
- **code-flow-mapper**: Traces execution paths and file relationships
- **planner**: Creates comprehensive implementation plans

#### Specialized Agents
- **task-router**: Analyzes task complexity and routes to appropriate workflow
- **code-reviewer**: Senior-level code review with prioritized feedback
- **security-auditor**: Security vulnerability detection
- **performance-analyzer**: Performance bottleneck identification
- **doc-generator**: Automated documentation creation

### 4. Hook System

Python scripts in `.claude/hooks/` that automate workflows:

#### task_prep_hook.py
- Triggers on: `/task`, `/analyze`, `/task_medium` commands
- Creates `claude-instance-{id}` directories automatically
- Manages incremental instance numbering
- Provides context to agents about directory locations

#### branch_manager_hook.py
- Suggests appropriate git branches based on task type
- Maps commands to branch prefixes (feature/, fix/, hotfix/, refactor/)
- Generates branch names from task descriptions

#### pre_commit_hook.py
- Runs before tool usage
- Ensures code quality standards
- Integrates with development workflow

### 5. Configuration Distribution

#### copy-claude-config.sh
A comprehensive shell script that:
- Validates target directory and permissions
- Creates automatic backups of existing configurations
- Copies all configuration files with proper structure
- Sets correct file permissions for hooks
- Provides post-installation verification
- Includes detailed error handling and logging

Features:
- Colored output for better readability
- Comprehensive help system (`--help`, `--version`)
- Security best practices implementation
- Detailed progress reporting

## Workflow Analysis

### /analyze Command Workflow

1. **Hook Activation**: task_prep_hook.py creates `claude-instance-{id}` directory
2. **Investigation Phase**: investigator agent analyzes codebase
3. **Flow Mapping**: code-flow-mapper traces execution paths
4. **Planning Phase**: planner agent creates implementation plan
5. **User Review**: Plan presented for approval/adjustment

### Task Routing System

The `/task` command uses intelligent routing:
1. task-router agent analyzes complexity
2. Routes to appropriate workflow:
   - SIMPLE → `/fix`
   - COMPLEX → `/analyze`
   - HOTFIX → `/hotfix`
   - REFACTOR → `/refactor`

## Security & Best Practices

### Permission Management
- Granular permission control in settings.json
- Allowed/denied bash commands explicitly listed
- Domain-specific WebFetch permissions
- MCP server access control

### Configuration Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Local settings separation (settings.local.json)
- Automatic backup creation during copy
- Proper file permissions (executable hooks)

### Development Best Practices
- Conventional commit standards
- Automated code review before commits
- Git branch management suggestions
- Comprehensive error handling

## Integration Points

### Git Integration
- Extensive git command permissions
- Automated branch suggestions
- Commit workflow automation
- Pre-commit quality checks

### Development Tools
- Make command integration
- npm/node.js compatibility
- Python hook execution via uv
- Testing framework support

### External Services
- Linear for project management
- Stripe for payments
- PostgreSQL for databases
- Figma for design assets
