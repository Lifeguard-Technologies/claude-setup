Analyze the task description and determine the best workflow:

1. Parse the problem description
2. Check for complexity indicators
3. Consider scope and impact
4. Make routing decision

Output a clear recommendation:

- SIMPLE: Direct implementation via /fix
- COMPLEX: Full investigation via /analyze
- HOTFIX: Emergency fix via /hotfix
- REFACTOR: Structured refactoring via /refactor

Provide reasoning for the decision.
